## Printf

This project replicates printf function.

In this project we learned:
- How printf really works
- New github features
- How to work as a team

The code was compiled using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c

## Files
- main.h : This file contains the prototypes and structure to be called
- _ putchar.c : putchar print
- print_c.c : this file prints a character
- print_s.c : this file prints a string
- print_num.c : this file prints a number regardles of its value
- printf.c : this file prints the output acording to the format specifier

## Prototype
int _printf(const char *format, ...)

## Usage
- prints a string to the standard output, according to the given format
- all files were compiled and then verified by Betty
- it returns the number of characters in the output string on success, and returns -1 otherwise
